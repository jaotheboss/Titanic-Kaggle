# Titanic-Kaggle
Code for the Kaggle Titanic Project

## Models Used for this Project:
    1. Neural Network
    2. XGBoost
    3. Logistic Regression
    
## Evaluation:
My reflections on this project are that the cleaning matters as much as, or perhaps even more, than the training of the models. 
The pre-processing and cleaning of the data took the most amount of my time, and even then, i was not able to crack the top 50%.

This has made me realize the importance of cleaning data, even more so compared to my previous encounters with data science projects.
Guess from here on out, i shall take the chance and opportunity to learn more about the different approaches and techniques there are to cleaning datasets.
